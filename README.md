AIA Control Board
=================

This is the firmware for akfrnswrth's Analog Integrated Amplifier's control board. 
Since this is a continuing work-in-progress, see the 
[most recent release] (https://github.com/akfrnswrth/AIA-Control-Board/releases)
for a working version.

This is currently a proof-of-concept; it doesn't interface with the the
preamp hardware yet.

Requirements
------------

This software requires specific tools to compile and specific hardware to run.

###Hardware

 * ATmega168 microcontroller
 * A 16-character M66004FP-based vacuum-fluorescent display connected to the 
   microcontroller's SPI bus and PB1 as chip select
 * A control interface, which can be either or both:
     * A pair of momentary buttons on PC0 and PC1
	 * A pair of rotary encoders connected to {PC2, PC3} and {PC4, PC5}
     * A TSOP4838 or similar IR receiver on PB0 and a Sony TV-compatible remote control
 * (Technically optional) A set of three MCP42xxx SPI digital potentiometers 
   daisy-chained to the microcontroller's SPI bus with PB2 as chip select.  
   The first pot in the chain controls volume, the second bass, and the third 
   treble.

###Software
 * AVR toolchain (avr-gcc, avr-binutils, avrdude)
 * Basic GNU utilities (cp, make, rm, etc.)

The AVR toolchain and GNU utilities are included in WinAVR.
